# Odin-sign-up-form

This is my attempt at the odin sign-up project. As per the project instructions I focused on the following aspects:

- Recreating a similar layout to the design graphic but with my own touches
- Styling forms
- Simple validation of various form input types
- Using javascript to implement a password match confirmation

I did not attempt to make this mobile friendly as per the instructions, but the layout should be responsive enough for some regular resizing.
